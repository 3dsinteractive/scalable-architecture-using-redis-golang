## 11.2 config-max-memory-and-eviction

1. Open 1.2-config-max-memory-and-eviction
$ cd 1.2-config-max-memory-and-eviction

2. Edit config in redic_cfg/redis.conf
# maxmemory 2g
# maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

3. Start redis
$ docker compose up -d
$ docker compose down

4. Reference from config file
# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
# is reached. You can select among five behaviors:
#
# volatile-lru -> Evict using approximated LRU among the keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lru -> Evict any key using approximated LRU.
# volatile-lfu -> Evict using approximated LFU among the keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lfu -> Evict any key using approximated LFU.
# volatile-random -> Remove a random key among the ones with an expire set.
# allkeys-random -> Remove a random key, any key.
# volatile-ttl -> Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
# noeviction -> Don't evict anything, just return an error on write operations.
#
# LRU means Least Recently Used
# LFU means Least Frequently Used
